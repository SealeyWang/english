## 1

When my husband was going into the dining room this morning,he dropped some coins on the flor.

- 时间状语从句
- 过去进行时态

when 引导的时间状语从句，说明主句的动作发生的时间

- is going 正在做 (现在进行时)
- was going is 变 过去式 was， 表示（过去进行时态）

he dropped some coins on the flor 是主句。 对于这句话来说 从句也可以放到主句后面，意思不变

## 2

- look for 表示找的过程
- find 表示找的结果
- them all = all of them

## 3

found two small coins on the floor.

这里 While = when 当...时候

过去进行时态交代背景，当我们在吃早餐的时候，小儿子 Tommy 在地板上找到了 2 个小硬币

## 4

- both 都（两个用 both）
- all 都 (三个及以上用 all)

# 过去进行时态

回顾以前学的时态

- 现在进行时态 lesson 31
- 一般现在时态 lesson 47 49
- 一般过去时态 67
- 现在完成时态 83
- 一般将来时态 91 补充 过去将来时态
- 过去进行时态 117
- 过去完成时态
- 过去将来时态

过去进行时态用法：表示过去某时刻或某个阶段正在进行的动作

结构： was/were + doing

- She was swimming yesterday afternoon.
- I was sleeping at ten last night

过去进行时尤用于 when,as,while 引导的时间状语从句中，用来说明主句动作发生的背景。

- When I was cooking he called.
- When He was crossing the street,he slipped.
- While we were having dinner, the doorbell rang.

否定疑问句在 was/were 上发生变化

- You were not listening to me.
- Were you listening to me?
- How were you feeling at that time?

- Yesterday when I was walking home, I saw a car accident
- Were you taking to me ?
- Who were you taking to just now ?
