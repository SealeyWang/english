  - 前一部分为陈述句
  - 后一部分为简短问句
  - 两部分用逗号隔开

- 陈述句肯定，则问句否定， 陈述句否定则问句肯定
  - 前肯后否
  - 前否后肯
- 问句主语 需与 主句主语一直，且问句用代词，不用名词
- 前后助动词，时态须保持一致。

- He hasn't left yet, has he?
- You have been here for long time. haven't you?
- There are few people left, are there? (few 很少，少到几乎没有，所以英文中当否定词用, few 修饰可数名词)
- There is little wine left, is there? (litter 少 同 few 当否定词用，修饰不可数名词)
- you dislike him, don't you? (dislike 不喜欢， 感觉是否定句，但是英文动词不当否定词用！所以前面是肯定)

# 直接引语 与 间接引语

- 直接引语，间接引语都是宾语。
- 直接引语： 一字不差地引用别人的话，需放在引号（单引号）内
- 间接引语： 用自己的话 转述 别人的话，不用引号，
  - 以宾语从句的形式出现

要注意人称和时态的变化

- 人称变化 （按中文的转述改就行）

### 时态变化：

1.  当即转述别人的话，动词（say tell）, 用一般现在时，直接引语 中的时态，不用做任何改变，放在 间接引语中
